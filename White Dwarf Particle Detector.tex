\begin{abstract}
If dark matter (DM) is capable of sufficiently heating a local region in a white dwarf, it will trigger runaway fusion and ignite a type 1a supernova.
This was originally proposed in \cite{Graham:2015apa} and used to constrain primordial black holes which transit and heat a white dwarf via dynamical friction.
In this paper, we extend the analysis of white dwarf DM detection to candidates with non-gravitational interactions that heat through the production of standard model (SM) particles.
We consider a general class of models in which DM-DM collisions, DM decays, or DM transits including a SM scattering interaction produce particles that subsequently deposit energy inside the star.
The existence of long-lived white dwarfs and the observed supernovae rate provide constraints for such models.
As a concrete example, we rule out supersymmetric Q-ball DM in a large region of parameter space fundamentally inaccessible to terrestrial detection.
It is also intriguing that the DM-induced ignition discussed in this work provide an alternative mechanism of triggering supernovae from sub-Chandrasekhar Mass progenitors.

Hadronic processes are shown in the upper panel and EM processes in the lower panel. 
High energy particles will induce showers that terminate into elastic thermalization of the WD ions, moving from left to right in the diagram. 
The quoted energies are for a $\sim 1.37 ~M_{\astrosun}$ WD, although the cartoon is qualitatively the same for all densities.}
