\begin{abstract}
If dark matter (DM) is capable of sufficiently heating a local region in a white dwarf, it will trigger runaway fusion and ignite a type 1a supernova.
This was originally proposed in \cite{Graham:2015apa} and used to constrain primordial black holes which transit and heat a white dwarf via dynamical friction.
In this paper, we extend the analysis of white dwarf DM detection to candidates with non-gravitational interactions that heat through the production of standard model (SM) particles.
We consider a general class of models in which DM-DM collisions, DM decays, or DM transits including a SM scattering interaction produce particles that subsequently deposit energy inside the star.
The existence of long-lived white dwarfs and the observed supernovae rate provide constraints for such models.
As a concrete example, we rule out supersymmetric Q-ball DM in a large region of parameter space fundamentally inaccessible to terrestrial detection.
It is also intriguing that the DM-induced ignition discussed in this work provide an alternative mechanism of triggering supernovae from sub-Chandrasekhar Mass progenitors.
