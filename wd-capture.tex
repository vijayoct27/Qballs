Here we give a more detailed discussion of DM capture and thermalization. 

\subsection{Capture Rate} 
For the DM to ultimately be captured, it must lose energy $\sim m_\chi v^2$, where $v$ is the DM velocity (in the rest frame of the WD) asymptotically far away.
Since typically $v \ll v_\text{esc}$, the DM has velocity $v_\text{esc}$ while in the star and must lose a fraction $(v/v_\text{esc})^2$ of its kinetic energy to become captured. 
Properly, the DM velocity is described by a boosted Maxwell distribution peaked at the galactic virial velocity $v_\text{halo} \sim 10^{-3}$.
However, this differs from the ordinary Maxwell distribution by only $\OO(1)$ factors \cite{Gould:1987ir}, and we can approximate it by (ignoring the exponential Boltzmann tail):
\begin{equation}
\frac{dn_\chi}{dv} \approx
\begin{cases}
  \frac{\rho_\chi}{m_\chi} \l \frac{v^2}{v_\text{halo}^3} \r  & v \leq v_\text{halo} \\
  0 & v > v_\text{halo}
  \end{cases}.
\end{equation} 
The DM capture rate is given by an integral of the DM transit rate weighted by a probability for capture $P_\text{cap}$
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\text{cap} \sim \int dv \frac{d \Gamma_\text{trans}}{dv} P_\text{cap}(v),
\end{equation}
where the (differential) transit rate is
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \Gamma_\text{trans}}{dv} \sim \frac{d n_\chi}{dv} R_\text{WD}^2 \l \frac{v_\text{esc}}{v}\r^2 v.
\end{equation}
$P_\text{cap}$ depends on both the \emph{average} number of scatters in a WD
\begin{equation}
\overbar{N}_\text{scat} \sim n_\text{ion} \sigma_{\chi A} R_\text{WD},
\end{equation}
and the number of scatters \emph{needed} for capture
\begin{equation}
N_\text{cap} \sim \text{max}\left \{1, \frac{m_\chi v^2}{m_\text{ion} v_\text{esc}^2}\right \},
\end{equation}
and is most generally expressed as a Poisson sum
\begin{equation}
P_\text{cap} = 1 - \sum^{N_\text{cap}-1}_{n=0} \exp(-\overbar{N}_\text{scat})\frac{(\overbar{N}_\text{scat})^n}{n!}.
\end{equation}
For our purposes we will approximate the sum as follows:
\begin{equation}
P_\text{cap} \approx 
\begin{cases}
 1 & \overbar{N}_\text{scat} > N_\text{cap} \\
 \overbar{N}_\text{scat} & \overbar{N}_\text{scat} < N_\text{cap} ~\text{and}~ N_\text{cap} = 1 \\
 0 & \text{else}
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}
Here we ignore the possibly of capture if $\overbar{N}_\text{scat} < N_\text{cap}$ except in the special case that only one scatter is needed for capture. 
If $\overbar{N}_\text{scat} > N_\text{cap}$, we assume all DM is captured.
Most accurately, this capture rate should be computed numerically, e.g. see \cite{Bramante:2017xlb} for a detailed calculation. 
However with the above simplifications we find that the capture rate is of order
\begin{align}
  \Gamma_\text{cap} &\sim \Gamma_\text{trans} \cdot 
  \text{min}\left\{1, \overbar{N}_\text{scat} \text{min}\{B,1\}\right\}, \\
  B &\equiv \frac{m_\text{ion} v_\text{esc}^2}{m_\chi v_\text{halo}^2}. 
  \nonumber
\end{align}
$B$ here encodes the necessity of multiple scattering for capture. 
For ultra-heavy DM $m_\chi > 10^{15} ~\GeV$, $B \ll 1$ and multiple scatters are always needed. 

\subsection{Thermalization and Collapse} 

We consider energy loss via spin-independent, elastic scattering of DM off ions with cross section $\sigma_{\chi A}$. 
For the remainder of this section all numerical quantities are evaluated at a WD density $n_\text{ion} \sim 10^{31} ~\cm^{-3}$, for which the relevant WD parameters are \cite{cococubed}: 
\begin{align}
M_\text{WD} &\sim 1.25 ~M_{\astrosun} \nonumber \\
R_\text{WD} &\sim 4000 ~\text{km} \nonumber \\
v_\text{esc} &\sim 2 \times 10^{-2}. 
\end{align}
We also assume a typical WD temperature $T \sim \text{keV}$.

To compare with existing constraints, we relate $\sigma_{\chi A}$ to the per-nucleon cross section. 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\chi A} = A^2 \l \frac{\mu_{\chi A}}{\mu_{\chi n}}\r^2 F^2(q) \sigma_{\chi n} \sim A^4 F^2(q) \sigma_{\chi n},
\end{equation}
where $F^2(q)$ is the Helm form factor \cite{Helm:1956zz}.
For DM at the WD escape velocity, the typical momentum transfer to ions is $q \sim \mu_{\chi A} v_\text{esc} \sim 200 ~\MeV$ and the energy transfer is $\omega \sim q^2/m_\x{ion} \sim ~\MeV$. 
As this $q$ is less than or of order the inverse nuclear size, DM scattering off nuclei will be coherently enhanced. 
We find $F^2(q) \approx 0.1$ for $q \sim 200 ~\MeV$.  
It follows that for any DM candidate satisfying the direct detection constraint \eqref{eq:xenon}, only a small fraction of transiting DM is captured by the star.

Once DM is captured, it thermalizes to an average velocity
\begin{equation}
  v_\text{th} \sim \sqrt{\frac{T}{m_\chi}} 
  \sim 10^{-12} \l \frac{m_\chi}{10^{16} ~\GeV}\r^{-1/2}
\end{equation}
and settles to the thermal radius
\begin{align}
  R_\text{th} &\sim \l \frac{T}{G m_\chi \rho_\text{WD}}\r^{1/2} \\
 &\sim 0.1 ~\cm \l \frac{m_\chi}{10^{16} ~\GeV}\r^{-1/2}, \nonumber
\end{align}
where its kinetic energy balances against the gravitational potential energy of the (enclosed) WD mass. 
This thermalization time can be explicitly calculated for elastic nuclear scatters \cite{Kouvaris:2010jy}. 
The stopping power due to such scatters is
\begin{align}
    \frac{dE}{dx} \sim \rho_\ion \sigma_{\chi A} \; v \; \text{max}\{v, v_\ion\} 
\end{align}
where $v_\ion \sim 10^{-4}$ is the thermal ion velocity. 
The maximum function indicates the transition between viscous and inertial drag. 
The DM first passes through the WD many times on a wide orbit until the size of its orbit decays to become contained in the star.
This takes a time
\begin{align}
  t_1 &\sim \l \frac{m_\chi}{m_\text{ion}} \r^{3/2} 
  \frac{R_\text{WD}}{v_\text{esc}} \frac{1}{\overbar{N}_\text{scat}} 
  \frac{1}{\text{max}\{\overbar{N}_\text{scat}, 1\}^{1/2}} \\
  &\sim 10^{15}~\text{s} \l \frac{m_\chi}{10^{16} ~\GeV} \r^{3/2} 
  \l \frac{\sigma_{\chi A}}{10^{-35} ~\cm^2} \r^{-3/2}. \nonumber
\end{align}
Subsequently, the DM completes many orbits within the star until dissipation further reduces the orbital size to the thermal radius.
This occurs after a time
\begin{align}
  t_2  &\approx \l \frac{m_\chi}{m_\text{ion}} \r 
  \frac{1}{n_\text{ion} \sigma_{\chi A}} \frac{1}{v_\text{ion}} \\
  &\sim 10^{13}~\text{s}\l \frac{m_\chi}{10^{16} ~\GeV} \r 
  \l \frac{\sigma_{\chi A}}{10^{-35} ~\cm^2} \r^{-1}. \nonumber
\end{align}
This dissipation is dominated by a period of viscous drag after the DM velocity has slowed below $v_\ion$
Note that $t_2$ is much larger than the time to complete a single orbit, which is simply the gravitational free-fall timescale:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:freefalltime}
t_\text{ff} \sim \sqrt{\frac{1}{G \rho_\text{WD}}} \sim 0.1 ~\text{s}.
\end{equation}

The DM will begin steadily accumulating at $R_\text{th}$ after a time $t_1 + t_2$.
Once the collected mass of DM at the thermal radius exceeds the WD mass within this volume, there is the possibility of self-gravitational collapse.
The time to collect a critical number of DM particles is 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Ncore}
    t_\text{sg} &\sim 
    \frac{\rho_\text{WD} R^3_\text{th}}{m_\chi \Gamma_\text{cap}} \\
    &\sim 10^{9} ~\text{s} \l \frac{m_\chi}{10^{16} ~\GeV} \r^{-1/2} 
    \l \frac{\sigma_{\chi A}}{10^{35} ~\cm^2} \r^{-1} \nonumber 
\end{align}
which is much smaller than the decay and thermalization scales $t_1$ and $t_2$.
Typically, the timescale for collapse is set by the DM sphere's ability to cool and shed gravitational potential energy.
This is initially just $t_2$, while the time to collapse at any given radius $r$ may quicken as the DM velocity rises again above $v_\ion$
\begin{align}
  t_\text{cool} &\sim t_2 \text{min}\{v_\text{ion}/v_\chi,1\} \\
  v_\chi &\sim \sqrt{\frac{G N m_\chi}{r}}, \nonumber
\end{align}
where $N$ is the number of collapsing DM particles. 
However, since the DM collection timescale is shorter than the cooling time $t_\text{sg} < t_2$, the dynamics of the collapse is initially set by further collection and adiabatic collapse. 
This over-collection will necessarily increase the number of collapsing DM particles and hasten the collapse until the collection time matches the cooling time.
