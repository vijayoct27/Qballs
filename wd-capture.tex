Here we give a more detailed discussion of DM capture and its subsequent evolution in a WD.

\subsection{Capture Rate}
Consider a spin-independent, elastic scattering off ions with cross section $\sigma_{\chi A}$.
For the DM to ultimately be captured, it must lose energy $\sim m_\chi v^2$, where $v$ is the DM velocity (in the rest frame of the WD) asymptotically far away.
Since typically $v \ll v_\text{esc}$, the DM has velocity $v_\text{esc}$ while in the star and must lose a fraction $(v/v_\text{esc})^2$ of its kinetic energy to become captured.
Properly, the DM velocity is described by a boosted Maxwell distribution peaked at the galactic virial velocity $v_\text{halo} \sim 10^{-3}$.
However, this differs from the ordinary Maxwell distribution by only $\OO(1)$ factors~\cite{Gould:1987ir}, and we can approximate it by (ignoring the exponential Boltzmann tail):
\begin{equation}
\frac{dn_\chi}{dv} \approx
\begin{cases}
  \frac{\rho_\chi}{m_\chi} \l \frac{v^2}{v_\text{halo}^3} \r  & v \leq v_\text{halo} \\
  0 & v > v_\text{halo}
  \end{cases}.
\end{equation}
The DM capture rate is given by an integral of the DM transit rate weighted by a probability for capture $P_\text{cap}$
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\text{cap} \sim \int dv \frac{d \Gamma_\text{trans}}{dv} P_\text{cap}(v),
\end{equation}
where the (differential) transit rate is
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \Gamma_\text{trans}}{dv} \sim \frac{d n_\chi}{dv} R_\text{WD}^2 \l \frac{v_\text{esc}}{v}\r^2 v.
\end{equation}
$P_\text{cap}$ depends on both the \emph{average} number of scatters in a WD
\begin{equation}
\overbar{N}_\text{scat} \sim n_\text{ion} \sigma_{\chi A} R_\text{WD},
\end{equation}
and the number of scatters \emph{needed} for capture
\begin{equation}
N_\text{cap} \sim \text{max}\left \{1, \frac{m_\chi v^2}{m_\text{ion} v_\text{esc}^2}\right \},
\end{equation}
and is most generally expressed as a Poisson sum
\begin{equation}
P_\text{cap} = 1 - \sum^{N_\text{cap}-1}_{n=0} \exp(-\overbar{N}_\text{scat})\frac{(\overbar{N}_\text{scat})^n}{n!}.
\end{equation}
For our purposes we will approximate the sum as follows:
\begin{equation}
P_\text{cap} \approx
\begin{cases}
 1 & \overbar{N}_\text{scat} > N_\text{cap} \\
 \overbar{N}_\text{scat} & \overbar{N}_\text{scat} < N_\text{cap} ~\text{and}~ N_\text{cap} = 1 \\
 0 & \text{else}
\end{cases}.
\end{equation}
Here we ignore the possibly of capture if $\overbar{N}_\text{scat} < N_\text{cap}$ except in the special case that only one scatter is needed for capture.
If $\overbar{N}_\text{scat} > N_\text{cap}$, we assume all DM is captured.
Most accurately, this capture rate should be computed numerically, e.g. see~\cite{Bramante:2017xlb} for a detailed calculation.
However with the above simplifications we find that the capture rate is of order
\begin{align}
  \Gamma_\text{cap} &\sim \Gamma_\text{trans} \cdot
  \text{min}\left\{1, \overbar{N}_\text{scat} \text{min}\{B,1\}\right\}, \\
  B &\equiv \frac{m_\text{ion} v_\text{esc}^2}{m_\chi v_\text{halo}^2}.
  \nonumber
\end{align}
$B$ here encodes the necessity of multiple scattering for capture.
For ultra-heavy DM $m_\chi > 10^{15} ~\GeV$, $B \ll 1$ and essentially multiple scatters are always needed.

To compare with existing direct detection constraints, we relate $\sigma_{\chi A}$ to the per-nucleon cross section
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{\chi A} = A^2 \l \frac{\mu_{\chi A}}{\mu_{\chi n}}\r^2 F^2(q) \sigma_{\chi n} \sim A^4 F^2(q) \sigma_{\chi n},
\end{equation}
where $F^2(q)$ is the Helm form factor~\cite{Helm:1956zz}.
For DM at the WD escape velocity, the typical momentum transfer to ions is $q \sim \mu_{\chi A} v_\text{esc} \sim 200 ~\MeV$ and the energy transfer is $q^2/m_\x{ion} \sim ~\MeV$.
As this $q$ is less than or of order the inverse nuclear size, DM scattering off nuclei will be coherently enhanced.
We find $F^2(q) \approx 0.1$ for $q \sim 200 ~\MeV$.
Currently, the most stringent bound on DM spin-independent nuclear cross sections~\cite{Aprile:2017iyp} is:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:xenon}
\sigma_{\chi n} < 5 \times 10^{-46} ~\text{cm}^2
\l \frac{m_\chi}{10^3 ~\GeV} \r.
\end{align}
It follows that for any DM candidate satisfying~\eqref{eq:xenon}, less than $1 \%$ of transiting DM is captured by the star.
Therefore, in the regime of interest the capture rate scales as
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_\text{cap} \propto \frac{\sigma_{\chi A}}{m_\chi^2}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Thermalization and Collapse}
For the remainder of this section all numerical quantities are evaluated at a central WD density $n_\text{ion} \sim 10^{31} ~\cm^{-3}$, for which the relevant WD parameters are~\cite{cococubed}:
\begin{align}
M_\text{WD} &\approx 1.25 ~M_{\astrosun} \nonumber \\
R_\text{WD} &\approx 4000 ~\text{km} \nonumber \\
v_\text{esc} &\approx 2 \times 10^{-2}.
\end{align}
Depending on the context, the relevant density may be the average value which is of order $n_\text{ion} \approx 10^{30} ~\cm^{-3}$.
We also assume a typical WD temperature $T \sim \text{keV}$.
In addition, for simplicity we take a fixed value of $\sigma_{\chi A}$ valid for the entire range of momentum transfers considered.

Once DM is captured, it thermalizes to an average velocity
\begin{equation}
  v_\text{th} \sim \sqrt{\frac{T}{m_\chi}}
  \approx 10^{-11} \l \frac{m_\chi}{10^{16} ~\GeV}\r^{-1/2},
\end{equation}
and settles to the thermal radius
\begin{align}
  R_\text{th} &\sim \l \frac{T}{G m_\chi \rho_\text{WD}}\r^{1/2} \\
 &\approx 0.1 ~\cm \l \frac{m_\chi}{10^{16} ~\GeV}\r^{-1/2}, \nonumber
\end{align}
where its kinetic energy balances against the gravitational potential energy of the (enclosed) WD mass.
This thermalization time can be explicitly calculated for elastic nuclear scatters~\cite{Kouvaris:2010jy}.
The stopping power due to such scatters is
\begin{align}
    \frac{dE}{dx} \sim \rho_\text{WD} \sigma_{\chi A} \; v \; \text{max}\{v, v_\ion\},
\end{align}
where $v_\ion \sim \sqrt{\frac{T}{m_\text{ion}}}$ is the thermal ion velocity.
The max function indicates the transition between ``viscous" and ``inertial" drag.
The DM first passes through the WD many times on a wide orbit until the size of its orbit decays to become contained in the star.
The timescale for this process is
\begin{align}
  t_1 &\sim \l \frac{m_\chi}{m_\text{ion}} \r^{3/2}
  \frac{R_\text{WD}}{v_\text{esc}} \frac{1}{\overbar{N}_\text{scat}}
  \frac{1}{\text{max}\{\overbar{N}_\text{scat}, 1\}^{1/2}} \\
  &\approx 7 \times 10^{16}~\text{s} \l \frac{m_\chi}{10^{16} ~\GeV} \r^{3/2}
  \l \frac{\sigma_{\chi A}}{10^{-35} ~\cm^2} \r^{-3/2}. \nonumber
\end{align}
Subsequently, the DM completes many orbits within the star until dissipation further reduces the orbital size to the thermal radius.
The timescale for this process is
\begin{align}
  t_2  &\sim \l \frac{m_\chi}{m_\text{ion}} \r
  \frac{1}{n_\text{ion} \sigma_{\chi A}} \frac{1}{v_\text{ion}} \\
  &\approx 10^{14}~\text{s}\l \frac{m_\chi}{10^{16} ~\GeV} \r
  \l \frac{\sigma_{\chi A}}{10^{-35} ~\cm^2} \r^{-1}. \nonumber
\end{align}
There is an additional $\OO(10)$ logarithmic enhancement of the timescale once the DM velocity has slowed below $v_\ion$.
Note that the two thermalization timescales are much larger than the gravitational free-fall timescale, which is the time to complete a single orbit:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:freefalltime}
t_\text{ff} \sim \sqrt{\frac{1}{G \rho_\text{WD}}} \approx 0.5 ~\text{s}.
\end{equation}

The DM will begin steadily accumulating at $R_\text{th}$ after a time $t_1 + t_2$.
Once the collected mass of DM at the thermal radius exceeds the WD mass within this volume, there is the possibility of self-gravitational collapse.
The time to collect a critical number $N_\text{sg}$ of DM particles is
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Ncore}
    t_\text{sg} &\sim \frac{N_\text{sg}}{\Gamma_\text{cap}}  \sim
    \frac{\rho_\text{WD} R^3_\text{th}}{m_\chi \Gamma_\text{cap}} \\
    &\approx 10^{10} ~\text{s} \l \frac{m_\chi}{10^{16} ~\GeV} \r^{-1/2}
    \l \frac{\sigma_{\chi A}}{10^{-35} ~\cm^2} \r^{-1}, \nonumber
\end{align}
Typically, the timescale for collapse is then set by the DM sphere's ability to cool and shed gravitational potential energy.
This is initially just $t_2$, while the time to collapse at any given radius $r$ decreases once the DM velocity rises again above $v_\ion$
\begin{align}
  t_\text{cool} &\sim t_2 \text{min}\{v_\text{ion}/v_\chi,1\} \\
  v_\chi &\sim \sqrt{\frac{G N m_\chi}{r}}, \nonumber
\end{align}
where $N$ is the number of collapsing DM particles.

There is a subtlety that arises in this DM core collapse for the large masses $m_\chi$ of interest to us.
The time to collect a self-gravitating number of particles $t_\text{sg} \propto m_\chi^{-1/2}$ decreases for larger DM masses.
However, the dynamics of the collapse is set by the cooling time, which is initially $t_\text{cool} \propto m_\chi$.
We find that for $m_\chi > 10^{14} ~\GeV$, the collection time is shorter than the cooling time $t_\text{sg} < t_\text{cool}$.
In fact, the collection time may even be shorter than the dynamical time $t_\text{ff}$.
This is the case for $m_\chi > 10^{19} ~\GeV$.
We consider the following scenarios:
If $t_\text{ff} < t_\text{sg} <t_\text{cool}$, the DM core will be driven to shrink because of the gravitational potential of the overcollecting DM.
The timescale for the shrinking is set by the capture rate of DM.
Ultimately, the collapsing DM core will consist of $N_\text{sg}$ enveloped in a ``halo" of $N \gg N_\text{sg}$ particles, which will also proceed to collapse.
If $t_\text{sg} < t_\text{ff} <t_\text{cool}$, the DM core will rapidly accumulate particles before dynamically adjusting.
Thus the number of collapsing particles is much larger than $N_\text{sg}$.
(Note that when $m_\chi > 10^{21} ~\GeV$, the number of particles necessary for self-gravitation $N_\text{sg}$ as defined in \eqref{eq:Ncore} is less than 2.
In this case we should properly take $N_\text{sg} = 2$.)

For DM candidates capable of igniting the WD with a single annihilation or collision, it is always the case that $t_{sg} < t_\text{cool}$.
For our constraints (see Figures~\ref{fig:capture-collision} and~\ref{fig:capture-decay}), \textcolor{blue}{we conservatively choose to take the number of collapsing DM particles to be $N \sim N_\text{sg}$.}
