\begin{abstract}
Dark matter that is capable of sufficiently heating a local region in a white dwarf will trigger runaway fusion and ignite a type Ia supernova.
This was originally proposed in~\cite{Graham:2015apa} and used to constrain primordial black holes which transit and heat a white dwarf via dynamical friction.
In this paper, we consider dark matter (DM) candidates that heat through the production of high-energy standard model (SM) particles, and show that such particles will efficiently thermalize the white dwarf medium and ignite supernovae.
Based on the existence of long-lived white dwarfs and the observed supernovae rate, we derive new constraints on ultra-heavy DM which produce SM particles through DM-DM annihilations, DM decays, and DM-SM scattering interactions in the stellar medium. 
As a concrete example, we rule out supersymmetric Q-ball DM in parameter space complementary to terrestrial bounds.
It is also intriguing that the DM-induced ignition discussed in this work provide an alternative mechanism of triggering supernovae from sub-Chandrasekhar Mass progenitors.
