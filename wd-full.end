\@doendnote{endnote58}{Note that the idea of using observations of WDs to constrain DM properties has been pursued before, e.g. through an anomalous heating of cold WDs\protect \nobreakspace  {}\cite {Bertone:2007ae, McCullough:2010ai} or a change in the equilibrium structure of WDs with DM cores\protect \nobreakspace  {}\cite {Leung:2013pra}. These are quite distinct from the observational signature considered in this work, which is the DM trigger of a type Ia SN (although see\protect \nobreakspace  {}\cite {Bramante:2015cua} for a related analysis.}
