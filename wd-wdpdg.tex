Here we provide a more detailed analysis of the stopping power (energy loss per distance traveled) of high-energy SM particles in a carbon-oxygen WD due to electromagnetic and strong interactions.
We consider incident electrons, photons, pions, and nucleons with kinetic energy greater than an $\MeV$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{WD Medium}
For the WD masses that we consider, the stellar medium consists of electrons and fully-ionized carbon nuclei with densities in the range $n_e = Z n_\ion \sim 10^{31} - 10^{33} ~\cm^{-3}$ where $Z=6$.
The internal temperature is $T \sim \keV$~\cite{KippenhahnWeigert}.
The electrons are a degenerate and predominantly relativistic free gas, with Fermi energy
\begin{equation}
  E_F \sim (3 \pi^2 n_e)^{1/3} \sim 1 -10 ~\MeV.
\end{equation}
The carbon ions, however, are non-degenerate and do not form a free gas. 
The plasma frequency due to ion-ion Coulomb interactions is given by
\begin{align}
\Omega_p = \l \frac{4 \pi n_\ion Z^2 \alpha}{m_\ion}\r^{1/2} \sim 1 - 10~\keV,
\end{align}
where $m_\ion$ is the ion mass.
Finally, the medium also contains thermal photons, though these are never significant for stopping particles as the photon number density $n_\gamma \sim T^3$ is much smaller than that of electrons or ions.

\subsection{Nuclear Interactions}
\label{sec:nuclear}

\paragraph{Elastic Scattering of Hadrons.}
Hadrons with energy less than the nuclear binding energy $E_\text{nuc} \sim 10~\MeV$ will predominantly stop due to elastic nuclear scatters with ions. 
These are hard scatters, resulting in a stopping power 
\begin{align}
  \frac{dE}{dx} \sim n_\ion \sigma_\el
\l \frac{m}{m_\ion}\r E
  \end{align}
for a hadron of mass $m \ll m_\ion$ and kinetic energy $E$. 
$\sigma_\el$ is the elastic nuclear scattering cross-section, which is of order $\sim \bn$ at these energies and drops to $\sim 0.1~\bn$ above $10~\MeV$~\cite{Tavernier}, ignoring the presence of various nuclear resonances in the range $1~\MeV$ to $10~\MeV$. 

\paragraph{Inelastic Scattering of Hadrons.}
For energies above $E_\text{nuc}$, the stopping of hadrons is dominated by inelastic nuclear scatters.
In such a collision, an incoming hadron interacts with one or more nucleons to produce a $\OO(1)$ number of additional hadrons which approximately split the initial energy.
At incident energy greater than $\sim \GeV$, the majority of secondary hadrons are pions with transverse momenta $\sim 100 ~\MeV$ \cite{Tavernier}.
Below $\sim \GeV$, it is found that roughly equal fractions of protons, neutrons, and pions are produced in each collision \cite{Pionnuclear}.
We will thus have a roughly collinear shower terminating at an energy $\sim 10~\MeV$ which consists of pions for most of the shower's development and converts to an mix of pions and nucleons in the final decade of energy.
This cascade is described by a radiative stopping power
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nucshower}
  \frac{dE}{dx} \sim n_\ion \sigma_\inel E,
\end{equation}
where the inelastic nuclear cross-section $\sigma_\inel$ is given by $\sigma_\inel \approx 100 ~\mbn$ and is roughly constant in energy~\cite{Tavernier}.
The total length of the shower is only logarithmically dependent on the initial hadron energy $E$,
\begin{align}
    X_\x{had} \sim \frac{1}{n_\ion \sigma_\inel} \log\l\frac{E}{10~\MeV}\r.
\end{align}

\paragraph{Photonuclear Interactions.}
Photons of energy greater than $10 ~\MeV$ can also strongly interact with nuclei through the production of virtual quark-antiquark pairs.
This is the dominant mode of photon energy loss at high energy.
The photonuclear scatter destroys the photon and fragments the nucleus, producing secondary hadrons in a shower analogous to that described above. 
The photonuclear cross-section $\sigma_{\gamma A}$ is roughly given by $\sigma_{\gamma A} \approx \alpha \sigma_\inel$, again ignoring the nuclear resonances that occur for $E \lesssim \GeV$.~\cite{Tavernier} 
For $E \gtrsim \GeV$, $\sigma_{\gamma A}$ is likely a slowly increasing function of energy due to the coherent interaction of the photon over multiple nucleons~\cite{Gerhardt:2010bj}, however, instead of extrapolating this behavior we conservatively take a constant photonuclear cross-section $\sigma_{\gamma A} \approx 1~\mbn$.

\paragraph{Electronucelar Interactions.}
Electrons can similarly lose energy to nuclei by radiating a virtual photon that undergoes a photonuclear scatter, which indeed provides the dominant energy loss for high energy electrons. 
The cross-section for this process is roughly given by the photonuclear cross-section, scaled by a factor representing the probability to radiate such a photon.
This can be estimated with the Weizsacker-Williams approximation, which gives a stopping power that is suppressed from the photonuclear result by $\alpha$ but enhanced by an $\OO(10)$ kinematic factor~ \cite{Gerhardt:2010bj}: 
\begin{align}
    \frac{dE}{dx} \sim 10^{-3} \cdot n_\ion \sigma_\inel E.
\end{align}
Unlike the photonuclear interaction, the electronuclear event is a radiative process that preserves the original electron while leaving hadronic showers in its wake.

\subsection{Radiative Processes}
\label{sec:emshowers}

Electromagentic showers due to successive bremsstrahlung and pair production events off carbon ions are the dominant stopping mechanisms for intermediate-energy electrons and photons.
Both of these processes result in radiative stopping powers, expressed semi-classically as~\cite{Klein:1998du} 
\begin{equation}
\l\frac{dE}{dx}\r \sim \frac{E}{X_0}, ~~~~ X_0^{-1} = 4 n_\ion Z^2 \frac{\alpha^3}{m_e^2} \log{\Lambda}.
\end{equation}
$X_0$ is the radiation length, and $\log\Lambda$ is a Coulomb form factor given by the range of effective impact parameters $b$:
\begin{align}
  \Lambda = \frac{b_\xmax}{b_\xmin} \sim \lambda_\TF m_e.
\end{align} 
The maximal impact parameter is set by the plasma screening length and the minimum by the electron mass, below which the semi-classical description breaks down. 
For the highest WD densities, we may indeed have that $\Lambda \lesssim 1$, in which case equation~\eqref{eq:SemiclassicalBrem} ought be replaced by a quantum mechanical result, such as the Bethe-Heitler formula~\cite{Bethe1934}.
This still results in a radiative stopping power, and so for simplicity we employ equation~\eqref{eq:SemiclassicalBrem} and take $\log{\Lambda} \sim \OO(1)$ for all WD densities.

\paragraph{LPM Suppression}
A radiative event involving momentum transfer $q$ to an ion must, quantum mechanically, occur over a length $\sim q^{-1}$. 
All ions within this region contribute to the scattering of the incident particle, and for sufficiently small $q$ this results in a decoherence that suppresses the formation of photons or electron-position pairs.
This is the ``Landau-Pomeranchuk-Midgal'' (LPM) effect. 
The momentum transfer $q$ in a given event decreases with increasing incident particle energy, and so the LPM effect will suppress radiative processes for energies greater than some scale $E_\LPM$. 
This can be calculated semi-classically~\cite{Klein:1998du}, 
\begin{align}
  E_\LPM = \frac{m_e^2 X_0 \alpha}{4 \pi}
  \approx 1~\MeV \l \frac{10^{32} \cm^{-3}}{n_\ion} \r.
\label{eq:LPM}
\end{align}
which is quite small due to the high ion density in the WD. 
The stopping power for bremsstrahlung and pair production at energies $E > E_\LPM$ is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bremloss}
\l\frac{dE}{dx}\r_\LPM \sim  \frac{E}{X_0} \l\frac{E_\LPM}{E} \r^{1/2} ~~~ E>E_\LPM.
\end{equation}

In addition to the LPM effect, soft bremsstrahlung may be suppressed in a medium as the emitted photon acquires an effective mass of order the plasma frequency $\Omega_p$.
However, for high-energy electrons this dielectric suppression only introduces a minor correction to \eqref{eq:bremloss}, in which soft radiation is already suppressed~\cite{Klein:1998du}.

Note that the LPM effect is less significant for higher-order electromagnetic processes since these generally involve larger momentum transfers for the same final-state kinematics.
Thus when the suppression factor exceeds $\OO(\alpha)$, these interactions should be considered.
For instance, the energy loss due to electron direct pair production $eN \to e^+ e^- e N$ and is found to exceed that of bremsstrahlung at an energy $\sim 10^{8} ~\GeV$ \cite{Gerhardt:2010bj}.
At such high energies the stopping power for photons/electrons is dominated by photonuclear and electronuclear interactions anyway.

\subsection{Elastic EM Scattering}
\label{sec:coulomb}

\paragraph{Coulomb Scattering off Carbon Ions.}
\label{sec:coulomb_ion}
Coulomb collisions with ions provide the dominant mechanism by which electrons with energy $1~\MeV \lesssim E \lesssim 10~\MeV$ thermalize ions.
In this scenario we may treat the ions as stationary and ignore their recoil during collisions.
The nuclear charge will be screened by the mobile electrons of the medium, so incident particles will scatter via a potential
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:ScreenedPotential}
V(\textbf{r}) = \frac{Z \alpha}{r} e^{-\lambda_\TF r}.
\end{align}
The screening length $\lambda_\TF$ is given in the Thomas-Fermi approximation by \cite{Teukolsky}
\begin{align}
\label{eq:TF}
    \lambda_\TF^{2} = \frac{E_F}{6 \pi \alpha n_e} 
    \sim \frac{1}{\alpha n_e^{2/3}}
\end{align}
where $E_F$ is the electron Fermi energy.
This plasma screening suppresses scatters with momentum transfers below $\sim \lambda_\TF^{-1}$, corresponding to a minimal energy transfer of $\omega_\xmin = \lambda_\TF^{-2} / 2 m_\ion$.
Ions may in principle also cause screening through lattice distortion, however this may be ignored as the sound speed of the lattice $c_s \sim 10^{-2}$ is much smaller than the speed of an incident relativistic electron. 
Using the Born approximation, we have a cross-section for energy transfer $\omega$
\begin{align}
\label{eq:CoulombOffIonsCrossSection}
  \frac{d \sigma}{d \omega} = 
  \frac{2 \pi Z^2 \alpha^2}{m_\ion\beta^2} 
  \frac{1}{(\omega + \omega_\xmin)^2}
\end{align}
and a stopping power 
\begin{align}
  \frac{dE}{d x} &= \int_{0}^{\omega_\xmax} d \omega \, n_\ion 
  \frac{d \sigma}{d \omega} \omega \nonumber\\
  \label{eq:StoppingPowerOffIons}
   &\approx \frac{2 \pi\, n_\ion Z^2 \alpha^2 }{m_\ion\beta^2} 
   \log\left( \frac{\omega_\xmax}{\omega_\xmin} \right)
\end{align}
where the second line is valid if $\omega_\xmax \gg \omega_\xmin$.
$\omega_\xmax$ is the maximum possible energy transfer. 
This may be due to 4-momentum conservation, or in the case of incident electrons, the impossibility of scattering to a final energy less than $E_F$. 
4-momentum conservation sets an upper bound $\omega_\kin$, which for a stationary target is
\begin{align}
  \omega_\kin &= \frac{2 m_\ion p^2}{m_\ion^2 + m^2 + 2E m_\ion}
\end{align}
with $p$, $E$ the incoming momentum and energy. 
The Fermi upper bound is simply $\omega_F = E - E_F$ so for incident electrons we take $\omega_\xmax = \min\l\omega_\kin, \omega_F\r$.

For scatters that transfer energy less than the plasma frequency $\Omega_p$, one may be concerned about phonon excitations.
We estimate this by treating each ion as an independent oscillator with frequency $\Omega_p$ (an Einstein solid) and compute the stopping power due to scatters which excite a single oscillator quanta. 
There are two key differences between this and the free ion case: incident particles must transfer an energy $\Omega_p$ and the cross-section to transfer momentum $q$ is suppressed by a factor $q^2 / 2 m_\ion\Omega_p = \omega_\x{free}/\Omega_p$. 
$\omega_\x{free}$ is the energy transfer that would accompany a free ion scatter with momentum transfer $q$. 
The resulting stopping power is unchanged from the free case~\eqref{eq:StoppingPowerOffIons}, as the increased energy transfer compensates for the suppressed cross-section:
\begin{align}
  d\sigma \cdot \omega \sim 
  d\sigma_\x{free} \frac{\omega_\x{free}}{\Omega_p} 
  \cdot \Omega_p \sim 
  d\sigma_\x{free} \cdot \omega_\x{free}.
\end{align}

Finally, we note that for more energetic incident particles the cross-section~\eqref{eq:CoulombOffIonsCrossSection} should be replaced to account for the recoil of the ion during collisions. 
In these scenarios, however, this stopping power is far subdominant to hadronic or electromagnetic showers. \\

\paragraph{Coulomb Scattering off Electrons.}
\label{sec:coulomb_elec}
The scattering of incident electrons with the degenerate electron sea determines the termination energy of electromagnetic showers, and so we focus here on that scenario. 
This calculation demands two considerations not present when scattering off ions: the targets are not stationary and they require a threshold energy transfer in order to be scattered out of the Fermi sea.
In the scenario of interest, however, these do not result in a parametrically different stopping power than was found for ions in equation~\eqref{eq:StoppingPowerOffIons}. 

For incident momenta much greater than the Fermi momentum, the relative velocity is of order the incident velocity and the deflection of the incident particle will generally be small. 
It is reasonable then that scattering proceeds, up to $\OO(1)$ factors, as though a heavy incident particle is striking a light, stationary target.  
The cross-section is then given by the usual result, 
\begin{align}
  \frac{d \sigma}{d \omega} \approx
  \frac{2 \pi \alpha^2}{E_F} \frac{1}{\omega^2},
  \label{eq:CoulombRelativisticApprox}
\end{align}
where we have accounted for the target's motion by replacing its mass with the relativistic inertia $\sqrt{m_e^2 + p^2} \approx E_F$.  We have ignored plasma screening, as Pauli-blocking will provide a more stringent cutoff on soft scatters in this case. 
Scatters which transfer an energy $\omega \leq E_F$ will have a suppressed contribution to the stopping power as they can only access a fraction of the Fermi sea. 
For incident energies $E \gg E_F$ it is sufficient to ignore these suppressed scatters, i.e.,
\begin{align}
  \frac{dE}{d x} &= \int_{E_F}^{\omega_\xmax} d \omega \, n_e 
  \frac{d \sigma}{d \omega} \omega \nonumber\\
  \label{eq:StoppingPowerOffElectrons}
   &\approx \frac{2 \pi\, n_e \alpha^2 }{E_F} 
   \log\left( \frac{\omega_\xmax}{E_F} \right)
\end{align}
where, as above, $\omega_\xmax = \min\l\omega_\kin, \omega_F\r$.
This derivation is admittedly quite heuristic, and so it has been checked with a detailed numerical calculation accounting fully for the target's motion and degeneracy.
Equation~\eqref{eq:StoppingPowerOffElectrons} is indeed a good approximation to the stopping power for incident energies larger than the Fermi energy. 

\paragraph{Compton Scattering}
\label{sec:compton}
For incident photon energies less than the Fermi energy, the dominant stopping is provided by Compton scatters with degenerate electrons. 
This stopping power differs parametrically from its usual form due to the target electron motion and degeneracy.

Consider an incident photon with energy $k \leq E_F$. 
Compton scatters will only occur off electrons moving roughly collinear with the photon momentum - a head-on collision would result in an energy loss for the electron, which is forbidden by Pauli exclusion. 
In the electron rest frame these collinear scatters are Thompson-like, and so the photon energy loss is dominated by backward scatters. 
For relativistic electrons near the Fermi surface, these scatters transfer an energy
\begin{align}
  \omega \approx k \l 1 - \frac{m_e^2}{4 E_F^2} \r \sim k.
\end{align}  
The cross-section can be taken in the electron rest frame, $\sigma_T \sim \alpha^2/m_e^2$, along with an `aiming' factor $1/4\pi$ to account for the restriction to initially parallel trajectories.  
Finally, for $k \ll E_F$ only those electrons near the top of the Fermi sea are available to scatter, so the photon interacts with an effective electron density of 
\begin{align}
    n_\x{eff} = \int_{E_F - k}^{E_F} g(E) \; dE 
    \approx 3 n_e \frac{k}{E_f}
\end{align}
where $g(E)$ is the Fermi density of states. This gives a stopping power 
\begin{align}
  \frac{dk}{dx} \approx \frac{\alpha^2 n_e k^2}{m_e^2 E_F}. 
\end{align}
